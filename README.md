# Bike_Demand_Estimation

In this study, I predict the demand for bike sharing services in Seoul using a publicly available dataset. There have been several analyses of this dataset on the Internet. However, here I aimed to employ a different set of techniques, specifically focusing on Deep Learning. This includes the use of a convolutional neural network, a tool which is not commonly used for these demand forecasting tasks. The result is a higher r2 than most of the published studies.
